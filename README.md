# EcoPulse
A collaborative initiative dedicated to gathering comprehensive household data worldwide. We focus on alternative power sources, properties, and sustainable energy solutions. With an open and transparent approach, anyone can contribute their data, while accessing curated reports

## Features

- **React**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture and allows for efficient rendering and state management.

- **Flask**: The backend is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. Flask allows for rapid development and provides a flexible and modular structure for building web applications.

- **API Endpoints**: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints to communicate with the frontend. These endpoints can be used to perform various operations such as fetching data, creating new resources, updating existing resources, and deleting resources.

- **Database Integration**: The project demonstrates integration with a database. It uses PostgreSQL as the preferred database system, but you can easily configure it to use your preferred database system.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The project includes a basic implementation of user authentication and authorization. It allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes based on their roles and permissions.

- **Webpack**: The project is bundled using Webpack, a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. Webpack helps optimize the application's performance by bundling and minifying the assets.
